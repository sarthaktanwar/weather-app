# weather-app
v1 

 here's a summary of a weather app that  built using Retrofit, Jetpack Compose, Dagger Hilt, Room, and Coroutine:

The app would allow users to view the current weather and forecast for their location or any other location of their choice.
The app  use Retrofit to fetch weather data from a weather API and display it using Jetpack Compose. Dagger Hilt would be used for dependency injection, 
allowing for easy management of dependencies such as Retrofit, Room, and other app components. Room would be used to store user's favourite weather locations,
allowing them to quickly access weather data for those locations. Finally, Coroutine would be used to manage asynchronous tasks, 
ensuring that the app remains responsive and performs well. Overall, the app would provide a user-friendly and efficient experience for accessing weather information.
